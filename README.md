# Repeat After Me

Project 3: Accessible Game

## Overview:
The game I developed is a rhythm and memory game.  The computer plays an incrementally increasing sequence of items at an accellerating rate.  The user must repeat the sequence at the same or a faster rate.  The sequence items can be pitches (musical tones), colors, or shapes.  The user can select the starting speed and the chord used for the pitches.  The interface is compatible with all pointing devices, touch screens, and has keyboard hotkeys enabled.  The game is also compatible with screen reader technology.

## System Requirements:
This should work in any modern web browser, but was tested specifically on the latest version of Chrome in Windows 10 and Android.  It is designed for use with screen readers and was tested for compatibility with NVDA, although slow speech rates can be problematic (70% or higher is recommended).

## How to run the application:
Simply open ./index.html in your preferred web browser.  This relies on the relative location of the accompanying files so do not remove it from this directory.  The application is also available at https://mattpen.github.io/csci5849-p3/.
